      	As an SPDash Partner, you will receive a 15% cash back for all transactions you help facilitate. If you're a consultant or have a client which you believe would benefit from SPDash, you can purchase the application on their behalf or have them purchase the application with them indentifying you as the SPDash partner who introduced them to SPDash. Once the purchase has been finalized, you will receive a 10% return on the final price of the transaction. It's that simple.
